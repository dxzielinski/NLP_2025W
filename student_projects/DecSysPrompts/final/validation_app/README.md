# JSON Validation Application

This project is a web-based application built using Streamlit for the manual validation of JSON files generated by a language model (LLM). The application allows users to view and edit JSON objects while providing context from the original text file from which the JSON was extracted.

## Features

- **View JSON Statements**: Users can view the full JSON statements generated by the LLM.
- **Edit JSON Variables**: Users can edit various fields in the JSON objects, such as actions and conditions.
- **Context Reference**: The application displays the original context from which the JSON was extracted, aiding users in their validation process.
- **Validation**: The application includes validation functions to ensure that edited JSON values conform to expected formats and rules.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd json-validation-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## Usage Guidelines

- Load the JSON file to view the statements.
- Edit the fields as necessary and validate the changes.
- Refer to the original context for better understanding and accuracy during validation.
